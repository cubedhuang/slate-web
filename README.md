# Slate

Slate is a simple but powerful bot that lets you watch YouTube Together, log ghost pings, play music, and dozens of more features!

### What are Discord Activities?

Activities are a new in-development voice channel feature, including YouTube Together which allows everyone in a call to queue up videos and interact with them together!

### How do I start a YouTube Together session?

After youâ€™ve invited Slate to your server, simply use the `;activity` in a voice channel to start using Activities!

### Key Features

- `;activity` and `;youtube` allow you to start certain Discord Activities sessions in voice channels.
- `;logs` lets you turn on logging for ghost pings, potentially obscene statuses, nickname changes, and more!
- `;play` and `;queue` let you play and see queued music in the background in voice channels and Spotify links and playlists work too!
- `;userinfo` looks up information like past usernames and nicknames about people in your server.
- `;lb` and `;rank` let you observe server activity with an XP system!

... use `;help` to try dozens more!
