						for the &quot;fun&quot; commands like <code>;count</code> and{" "}
						<code>;multiply</code>.

					<li>
						We store past usernames and nicknames associated with specific user
						IDs. This is used for the <code>;userinfo</code> command and
						moderation purposes.
					</li>
					<li>
						We store user IDs in order to keep user experience for the{" "}
						<code>;rank</code> and <code>;leaderboard</code> commands.
					</li>

						server-specific settings. This includes, but is not necessarily
						limited to custom prefixes, disabled channels, logging channels, and

						We observe (but don't store) presence changes in order to facilitate
						logs for possibly obscene statuses.
